# AI Agent Framework

A lightweight starter repository for experimenting with AI agent workflows, orchestration patterns, and reusable utilities. This repo focuses on clarity and extensibility for future agents.

## Goals
- Provide a clean foundation for building agent-based workflows
- Capture best practices for modular agent design
- Keep the project minimal so it can grow with future implementations

## Planned Capabilities
- Agent orchestration and task routing
- Tool invocation and context management
- Structured logging for agent runs
- Configuration-driven agent definitions

## Getting Started
```sh
# Clone the repository
# Replace with your Git URL

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd ai-agent-framework

# Install dependencies (add when ready)
```

## Project Structure
- `src/` — agent logic and shared utilities (to be added)
- `docs/` — design notes, diagrams, and runbooks (to be added)
- `examples/` — sample agent flows and usage (to be added)

## Roadmap
- Add base agent interface
- Add tool registry and dispatcher
- Add sample agent flows
